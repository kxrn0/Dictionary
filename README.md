## Overview

### The challenge

- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Vite PWA plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) - For native app like functionality

### What I learned

It's the first time I've tried out styled components and SCSS, so the CSS code is a bit all over the place.
In the future I'll make sure to structure my app more carefully.
